/**
 * Update `feed` and `result-requests` collections adding a new field (feedFullName) to avoid use random generated id.
 * To achieve this, the following changes have been made to `feed` and `result-requests`
 *
 * feed
 *   - `feedFullName` field has been added
 *   - `request` field has been removed
 *
 *  result-requests
 *   - `feedFullName` field has been added
 *   - `feedId` field has been removed
 *   - `label` field has been removed
 *   - `address` field has been removed
 *
 * Models before the migration were:
 *   Feed {
 *     id: String!
 *     name: String!
 *     address: String!
 *     lastResult: String
 *     label: String!
 *     network: String!
 *     requests: [ResultRequest]!
 *     color: String!
 *     blockExplorer: String!
 *   }
 *
 *   ResultRequest {
 *     id: String!
 *     feedId: String!
 *     result: String!
 *     label: String!
 *     requestId: String!
 *     address: String!
 *     timestamp: String!
 *     drTxHash: String!
 *     error: String
 *   }
 *
 * Models after the migration are:
 *
 *   Feed {
 *     id: String!
 *     address: String!
 *     blockExplorer: String!
 *     color: String!
 *     feedFullName: String!
 *     label: String!
